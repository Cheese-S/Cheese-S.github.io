## About Rabbit Hole Journey

At such an early stage of my career, it is not unusual for me to encounter something that I possess zero knowledge of. More often than not, while trying to understand that "something", I find myself ignorant in the face of another thing. 

Thus, this website is built. It acts as a blog/journal of my experience of going down one rabbit hole after another. May this website serve to shine some lights for my fellow learner.  

At last, a cheesy yet effective inspirational quote from one of my favorite movies, <em>Whiplash</em>

>But is there a line? You know, maybe you go too far and discourage the next Charlie Parker from ever becoming Charlie Parker?

>No, man, no. Because the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged.
