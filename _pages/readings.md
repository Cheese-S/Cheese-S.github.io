This is a list of all the programming related books / papers I have read (or am reading) and truly recommend. There is no particular order in which each item is listed. 

### C
- [C Programming Language, 2nd Edition Book by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)

### C++
- [Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example Book by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerated-C-Practical-Programming-Example/dp/020170353X)
- [Effective Modern C++ Book by Scott Meyers](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996)

### Useful Papers
- [Stonebraker, Michael, and Joseph Hellerstein. "What Goes Around Comes Around." In Readings in Database Systems](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yanlei/courses/CS691LL-f06/papers/SH05.pdf)
  - Paper about the history of query language and database models.
- [Hellerstein, Joseph, Michael Stonebraker, and James Hamilton. "Architecture of a Database System." Foundations and Trends in Databases 1, no. 2 (2007): 141-259.](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/papers/fntdb07-architecture.pdf)
  - Paper about the internals of a database system. It supplies a general idea of the system without exploring too much detail. The format of the paper makes it seems longer than it actually is.
